On August 15, 2023, I founded Zucagram, a network social organization aimed at Brazilian immigrants and those who dream of immigrate. Initially, it was just a project to consolidate my studies in React and create a support space for Brazilians in Portugal.\n
            After just two months, Zucagram already had almost 300 users and my mind was buzzing with new ideas. It was then that I realized the Zucagram's growth potential.\n
            At this stage, my friend and mentor Fel√≠cio Santos had already helped me countless times with technical challenges that I couldn't solve alone. Recognizing my limitations, I invited him to join to the project, transforming it from a simple study project into a startup.\n
            Our goal now is to reach all Brazilians around the world world, creating a solid community where we can share our stories and experiences, offer help with information and even in person, if necessary. Because, if you are Brazilian, where wherever you are, you are not alone...\n
            Today, with almost ten months of existence, Zucagram is about to reach your first thousand users. The website has been completely restructured, we are now in the Apple Store and, by the end of the month, we will also be on the Play Store.\n I invite you all to get to know Zucagram, especially if you You are an immigrant or have the dream of living abroad.`}
