          I've participated in a few interviews and I'm always eliminated from the list.
 process due to lack of experience. So I asked myself: how am I going to
 gain experience if they don't give me a chance? <br /> <br />
 From this reflection, I started thinking about how programming
 I could solve problems in my daily life. Currently, I work in
 a car wash on Saturdays to supplement my income. There,
 we fill out a form by hand and, at the end of the day, we do the math
 to close the box. This gave me the idea to create an app for
 register the cars we wash and generate a report with one click
 at the end of the day. <br /> <br />
 I developed this project in React with NextJS and Tailwind CSS, and the
 I hosted it on Vercel to access it on my smartphone as an app
 through webmanifest.

          <p>
          I was hired by a client who sells 3D wheels for cars
 HotWheels, with the aim of creating a website to showcase your products
 and reach a wider audience across Europe. <br /> <br />
 The project was developed using NextJS with TypeScript and
 Tailwind CSS to ensure agility and responsiveness. <br /> <br />
 In addition to developing the website, I also created banners using
 Canva Pro to show real product images. <br /> <br />
 I chose to host the project at Vercel, taking advantage of its integration
 with GitHub to facilitate the automated deployment process.{" "}
 <br /> <br />
 To ensure the client's online presence, I registered their domain on
 Hostinger and configured the DNS to point to Vercel, ensuring
 for the domain to redirect to the hosted project. <br /> <br />
 This project represented a rewarding challenge for me, being the
 first time someone trusted their investment for me to create
 something for him. <br /> <br />
 I completed all the work in just 7 days, dedicating my nights
 after working hours at the factory. <br /> <br />
 Note: Products and some content will still be added
 as soon as the customer makes them available.
